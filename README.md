# BentoGrid
Frontend Mentor Challenge, [**BentoGrid**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj)

# Introduction

Last year, I spent about two months exploring HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, I dropped it and have been trying to get back into it ever since. This project will serve as my demo projectâ€”an opportunity to rebuild my skills and regain momentum. Iâ€™ve chosen a Bento grid layout because itâ€™s simple enough that I wonâ€™t get stuck for too long, allowing me to focus on consistency and progress.

# Objectives
- Become proficient in GitHub and its commands.

- Learn how to set up projects and follow a proper workflow.

- Improve my understanding of HTML terminology.

- Prove to myself that I can start and finish a project independently.

- Set a clear deadline to avoid procrastination and stay accountable.

This project is my way of making sure I follow through and build a solid foundation for future web development work. ðŸš€

# Day 1

I succesfully made a repo, cloned it, and commit changes. I also added a new SSHkey. I still have a couple of things I need to polish but so far it is a good progress.
