# BentoGrid
Frontend Mentor Challenge, [**BentoGrid**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj)

# Introduction

Last year, I spent about two months exploring HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, I dropped it and have been trying to get back into it ever since. This project will serve as my demo projectâ€”an opportunity to rebuild my skills and regain momentum. Iâ€™ve chosen a Bento grid layout because itâ€™s simple enough that I wonâ€™t get stuck for too long, allowing me to focus on consistency and progress.

### Objectives

- Become proficient in GitHub and its commands.

- Learn how to set up projects and follow a proper workflow.

- Improve my understanding of HTML terminology.

- Prove to myself that I can start and finish a project independently.

- Set a clear deadline to avoid procrastination and stay accountable.

This project is my way of making sure I follow through and build a solid foundation for future web development work. ðŸš€

# Day 1

I succesfully made a repo, cloned it, and commit changes. I also added a new SSHkey. I still have a couple of things I need to polish regarding to github but, so far, it is a good progress.

# Day 2

Since I've been working with a JPEG some of the measurements are not right, I will redo the file on Figma to have a better understanding of it and link it here. Aside from that I managed to add the fonts and give some color to the page, It shouldnt take me long to position all the sentences correctly.

I still have some issues with Github, mostly that my commits go to all the changes i've done.

### <ins>Done:</ins>
- 4.5 grids out of 8

### <ins>To Do after figma+sentences:</ins>
- Work out the `@media` logic

# Day 3

I read the supporting documents of the challenge and there are a few issues, mostly with the font sizes (I've been eye-balling rems) It also said something about using the .JPGs provided, Im not opposed to the idea, Im using most of the images they provided but there are a few in which the background is not transparent and the pixel dittering damages the quality, for those cases I replicated the image on Ai (Adobe Illustrator from now on)

### <ins>Done:</ins>
- 8/8 grid elements
- Redid the fonts and colors
- Fixed the little margin issues on the page
- Finished the Ai main template

### <ins>To Do:</ins>
- Do a tablet version of the page
- Transfer files from Ai to Figma
- Figure out the commits
- Work out the @media logic
