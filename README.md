# BentoGrid
Frontend Mentor Challenge, [**BentoGrid**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj)

# Introduction

Last year, I spent about two months exploring HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, I dropped it and have been trying to get back into it ever since. This project will serve as my demo project—an opportunity to rebuild my skills and regain momentum. I’ve chosen a Bento grid layout because it’s simple enough that I won’t get stuck for too long, allowing me to focus on consistency and progress.

# Objectives
- Become proficient in GitHub and its commands.

- Learn how to set up projects and follow a proper workflow.

- Improve my understanding of HTML terminology.

- Prove to myself that I can start and finish a project independently.

- Set a clear deadline to avoid procrastination and stay accountable.

This project is my way of making sure I follow through and build a solid foundation for future web development work. 🚀

# Day 1

I succesfully made a repo, cloned it, and commit changes. I also added a new SSHkey. I still have a couple of things I need to polish regarding to github but, so far, it is a good progress.

# Day 2

Since I've been working with a JPEG some of the measurements are not right, I will redo the file on Figma to have a better understanding of it and link it here. Aside from that I managed to add the fonts and give some color to the page, It shouldnt take me long to position all the sentences correctly.

I still have some issues with Github, mostly that my commits go to all the changes i've done.

**Done**:
4.5 grids out of 8

**To Do** after figma+sentences:
- Work out the @media logic
